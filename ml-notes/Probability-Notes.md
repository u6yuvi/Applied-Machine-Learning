Geometric distribution is a probability distribution that describes the number of times a Bernoulli trial needs to be conducted in order to get the first success after a consecutive number of failures.

X- Random Variable -counts the number of trials required to obtain the first success.

p = Success probability

PMF = (1-p)^(x-1) * p 

CDF = P(X<=x) = 1- (1-p)^x

Mean = 1/p

Variance - (1-p) /p^2
